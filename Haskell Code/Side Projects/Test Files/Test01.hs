module Test01 where

--Trying to make a prime factorization program. Once I complete that, I want to
--find the composition of squares of a certain number, so sqrt 28 -> sqrt 4*7.
--It would then take the 4 and return the square root of that so that it then
--returns a square which makes up 28. It should also do multiple squares, such as
--sqrt of 4*9*7, which would then return 2 and 3
