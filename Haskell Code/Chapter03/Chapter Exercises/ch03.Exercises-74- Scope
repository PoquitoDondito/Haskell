--with your gut here.
-- Prelude> let f = 3
-- Prelude> let g = 6 * f + h
--Answer: h is not in scope for g

--3.
--This code sample is from a source file. Is everything we need to execute area
--in scope?
-- area d = pi * (r * r)
-- r = d / 2
--Answer: No, because d is local to area

--4.
--This code is also from a source file. Now are r and d in scope for area?
-- area d = pi * (r * r)
--    where r = d / 2
--Answer: Yes
